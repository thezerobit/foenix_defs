A collection of C header files for the C256 Foenix.

The convertdefs.py Python script will convert the *_def.asm files from the https://github.com/Trinity-11/Kernel_FMX 
repo if it is cloned in the same parent folder as this repo.

For now, the conversion just defines the raw hex and decimal values.
You will have to cast memory addresses to the appropriate C types in your own code.

These files are distributed under the same license as the source ASM files.
